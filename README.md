# Test_Problems
A repository with some solutions of the test problems from the Programming 1 course I took at the Federal University of Alagoas.
These problems were proposed to us by using the website https://www.thehuxley.com.
I'm going to append all the links to the individual problems below, so you can read what the problem asks and then read my code where I give a solution to the problem proposed.
